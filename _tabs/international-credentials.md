### International Transcripts
{: .typography__h3 }

**Foreign College Courses:** \
If you are pursuing a degree or would like to receive college credit for college courses completed in a foreign country, please carefully review the information on this page. Courses you took at another college or university that pertain to your program of study may count toward your degree. To determine if these courses are eligible, submit a [transcript evaluation request](https://form.jotform.com/52565419679975){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' } to KCCâ€™s Admissions and Registration Office in addition to a course-by-course evaluation.

**Foreign High School Courses:** \
If you are a prospective international student (abroad or currently in F-1 status) or a permanent resident planning on utilizing financial aid: submit your foreign secondary school credentials/transcripts in a sealed envelope from the originating institution/high school, certified English translations, and an official evaluation to KCC's Office of Admission and Registration. Equivalency to a U.S. high school education must be noted on the evaluation. GPA is not required.

If you are a prospective international student (abroad or currently in F-1 status), please visit [Admissions - international student](#international-student) for more information and contact [dso@kcc.edu](mailto:dso@kcc.edu) if you have questions/concerns.

#### Important Notes

KCC will only accept evaluations from agencies affiliated with the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) for out-of-country institutions. A [list of evaluation agencies](?id=evaluation-agencies#international-credentials) KCC is familiar with is on this page.

- It is recommended that you request an evaluation of your transcripts by an evaluation agency prior to registering for courses at KCC. Registering prior to the completion of the official evaluation may have financial aid and course implications.
- Completing an evaluation does not guarantee transfer of college credit to Kankakee Community College.
- Official evaluation reports may be mailed from the agency to KCC with attention to Admissions & Registration or emailed directly to [snelson@kcc.edu](mailto:snelson@kcc.edu).
