order: 5

If you are not using previous test scores or previous college coursework for placement, you can take KCC's placement tests. No appointment is required to take the exams. For information, visit [the testing page](./testing)â€‹.

High school students who have completed one or more AP exams must have their scores sent directly to KCC before credit can be evaluated and awarded. KCC accepts limited credit hours by exam, so please check with the [Office of Admissions and Registration](./) before taking multiple AP exams. Please review [Advanced Placement (AP)](./credit-for-prior-learning/#advanced-placement-ap) for a listing of which exams KCC will accept credit for.

The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) is a national credit-by-examination program which gives high school and college bound students of a wide range of ages the opportunity to earn college credit for what they already know, regardless of how that knowledge was acquired.

Currently, CLEP testing is not available through KCC, but KCC does accept certain CLEP exams as long as scores meet minimum requirements. Information on CLEP exams, testing sites, etc., can be found by going to the College Board website's [CLEP information page](https://www.collegeboard.com/highered/clep){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' }. Overall, KCC accepts limited credit hours by exam so please check with the Office of Admissions and Registration before taking multiple CLEP exams. Also, students must have their scores mailed from CLEP directly to KCC before credit can be evaluated and awarded. Please see [College Level Examination Program (CLEP)](./credit-for-prior-learning/#college-level-examination-program-clep) for a listing of which exams KCC will accept credit for.
