Request a transcript through the National Student Clearinghouse. The website will walk you through the ordering process. There is a $5 fee per copy and you can pay with a debit or credit card. Emails from the National Student Clearinghouse will be sent to update you on your order.

Delivery options include:

* Electronic (sent usually within one hour)
* Mail (sent next business day)
* Hold for Pickup (ready by noon next business day in Student Affairs at KCC)

If you are choosing the electronic delivery method, please note:

* Electronic transcripts will expire after 30 days of receiving the link and password emails from the Clearinghouse. Be sure to open your electronic transcript upon receipt.
* Please verify that the school, organization or individual will accept electronic transcripts and is aware of the expiration. It is up to the school, organization or individual to accept electronic transcripts that are printed or emails that are forwarded to them as official; normally, they will be unofficial.
* If your school or organization does not belong to the Clearinghouse’s electronic exchange, you will need to provide an email address for that school or organization.
* Please enter the email address accurately. A new order will need to be placed if the email address was misspelled or the incorrect email address was entered. We cannot change the email address to resend the transcript.
